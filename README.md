# replay_buffer

Implementation of the multiple version of the Replay Buffers for Reinforcement Learning.

- replay_buffer_npz.py: Allocate data as numpy & save buffer as npz file.
- replay_buffer_disc.py: Save transition data as a npz file in the disc rather than in RAM (for efficient memory usage).
